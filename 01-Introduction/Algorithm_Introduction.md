## What is Algorithm?
**Definition:**
- Step-by-step procedure of solving a computational problem

## Difference between Algorithm and program

| Algorithm | Program |
| -- | --|
| Step-by-step procedure of solving a computational problem | Step-by-step procedure of solving a computational problem |

Both have the same definition

| Algorithm | Program |
| -- | --|
| Implemented during **Design phase** of software design lifecycle | Implemented during **Implementation phase** of software design lifecycle |
| Using simple English like statement without proper syntax i.e **pseudo lanugage** | Using **programming language** |
| Written by **person with enough knowledge of the domain** for which he/she is trying to solve a problem | Written by a **programmer** |
| As we write the procedure in pseudo lanugage. Hence, the algorithm is **Hardware and OS independent** | Programming language are **Hardware and OS dependent**. So is the program eventually |
| After writing an algorithm we **analyse** to check if the results are achievable and whether the algorithm is efficient | We run the program and **test** for the desired output |
